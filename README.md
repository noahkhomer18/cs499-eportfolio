# CS-499 Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio  
**Southern New Hampshire University | Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**

## Overview
This repository contains my final capstone ePortfolio for the SNHU Computer Science program. It demonstrates the integration of all the technical and professional skills I developed throughout my coursework using my full-stack **Trip Management Application**. The project highlights growth in three major areas of computer science: **software design and engineering**, **algorithms and data structures**, and **databases**.

The goal of this ePortfolio is to show complete proficiency in developing, enhancing, and securing real-world applications while following best practices in software engineering, database management, and algorithmic logic.

## Project Purpose
This project expands upon my original **CS-465 Full-Stack Trip Management App**, which was built using Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB. The application allows users to register, log in, and manage trips by performing create, read, update, and delete operations.  

For the capstone, I significantly enhanced the app to improve structure, efficiency, and security. The enhancements include:
- JWT-based authentication with token persistence and protected routes.
- Database schema redesign for improved query speed and validation.
- Algorithmic optimization for trip filtering, sorting, and data handling.
- Modular Angular architecture and reusable services for scalability.

The final version represents my ability to design professional-grade software with full-stack integration.

## Artifacts and Enhancements

| Enhancement | Category | Description |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Enhancement One** | **Software Design & Engineering** | Refactored the Angular frontend and Node.js backend into a modular architecture. Added routing guards, interceptors, and authentication flows for improved user experience. Improved RESTful API design, folder structure, and UI layout. |
| **Enhancement Two** | **Algorithms & Data Structures** | Optimized trip filtering and sorting algorithms using efficient JavaScript data structures. Enhanced performance through asynchronous handling of API calls with Promises and Observables. Reduced redundant loops and improved time complexity in core functions. |
| **Enhancement Three** | **Databases** | Enhanced MongoDB schema design and implemented Mongoose validation. Added token-based security and database middleware for automatic field population. Used aggregation pipelines to generate analytics and summaries on user trips. |

Each enhancement represents a direct improvement to scalability, maintainability, and performance, while also aligning with professional software development standards.

## Professional Self-Assessment Summary
This capstone reflects my growth from foundational coding assignments to building and securing complete systems. Through this project, I demonstrated:
- The ability to create modular, secure, and maintainable full-stack applications.
- Practical understanding of authentication, authorization, and database design.
- Experience using modern frameworks such as Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB.
- A problem-solving mindset that uses algorithmic logic to improve performance.
- The discipline to manage the full software development lifecycle with testing, documentation, and deployment.

The ePortfolio as a whole represents how my coursework and projects prepared me for a professional software engineering role.

# CS 499 ePortfolio

This repository hosts my CS 499 Capstone ePortfolio. It is organized around three enhancement categories required by the capstone:

- Software Design and Engineering
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

Use the branches to navigate each categoryâ€™s work:

- `software-engineer`: Enhancements in software design and engineering
- `algorithms`: Enhancements in algorithms and data structures
- `database`: Enhancements in databases

Main branch contains shared materials:

- `self-assessment/ProfessionalSelfAssessment.md`
- `code-review/CodeReviewPlan.md`

## How to View
1. Switch branches on GitHub to view the category-specific content.
2. Each branch includes artifacts (original and enhanced) and narratives.

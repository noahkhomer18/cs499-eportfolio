# Professional Self-Assessment — Noah Khomer

## Introduction
My name is Noah Khomer. I completed dual bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science (Software Engineering) and Business Administration (Project Management & Information Systems). This ePortfolio represents my growth as both a developer and a problem solver. It showcases progress in software design, databases, and algorithms—and how I learned to balance creativity, structure, and user‑focused design.

## Program Journey and Growth
I started with basic coding skills and limited understanding of how large systems come together. Courses like CS‑465 (Full Stack Development) changed that by forcing me to connect frontend, backend, and data. I built Travlr Getaways, my first real client–server app. Returning to it for CS‑499, I redesigned parts of the backend, strengthened the database, and added JWT‑based auth and security. That experience showed me growth not just in code, but in designing for scalability and UX.

Independently, I worked on a reinforcement learning project (Pirate Agent RL). It pushed me into optimization, data‑driven iteration, and algorithmic thinking. Together, these projects moved me from “writing code” to “engineering systems.”

## Skills Overview
### Collaborating in a Team Environment
I used GitHub/GitLab, pull requests, issue tracking, and lightweight Scrum boards (Trello/Jira). I’m comfortable with branching strategies, code reviews, and resolving merge conflicts. Clear commit messages and small PRs became part of my routine.

### Communicating With Stakeholders
I tailor communication based on audience—visual and plain‑language for non‑technical stakeholders; structured and detailed for engineers. I’ve presented designs, wrote docs, and created diagrams that improved shared understanding.

### Data Structures and Algorithms
In Pirate Agent RL, I optimized state/action handling and exploration strategies, which improved runtime and stability. I use complexity awareness (time/space) to guide design trade‑offs and refactors.

### Software Engineering and Design
I emphasize modular design, separation of concerns, and testing. I’ve used automated testing (e.g., Jasmine/Mocha) and basic CI to keep quality high. I strive for code that’s understandable today and maintainable later.

### Databases
With MongoDB and relational concepts, I’ve designed schemas, added indexes, and used aggregation pipelines for analytics. In Travlr Getaways, I implemented user–trip–review relationships, RBAC, and performance‑minded queries.

### Security Mindset
I incorporate validation, JWT auth, password hashing, and role‑based access control. Thinking adversarially changed how I plan features and review code.

## How the Artifacts Fit Together
- Software Engineering & Design (Pirate Agent RL): shows planning, structure, and testing in a complex system.
- Algorithms & Data Structures (Pirate Agent RL): shows performance thinking and optimization.
- Databases (Travlr Getaways): shows full‑stack integration, schema design, and security.
Together, they show a path from building features to engineering reliable, data‑driven systems.

## Professional Goals and Values
Short term, I’m focused on full‑stack and backend roles with opportunities to apply AI responsibly. Long term, I aim for a master’s in CS or analytics and roles that blend engineering and leadership. Curiosity and continuous learning drive me—I like turning ideas into working, useful software.

## Closing
Thank you for reviewing my work. Each artifact represents a step forward. I invite you to explore the enhancements and reflections across software engineering, algorithms, and databases.
